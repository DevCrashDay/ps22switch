"""Code window support: the segments a game rewrites at runtime.

An executable LOAD segment with no file contents is a code window: the game
unpacks a different image into it as it goes, so no single translation of the
area can be right. The recompiler instead takes one module per image of the
window, and the runtime picks the image in place by its check words.

  windows.py list <elf>              print "base size" per window, one per line
  windows.py capture <elf> <dump> <dir> [<misses file>]
                                     save the image of every window found in
                                     the RAM dump to <dir>/<base>_<crc>.bin,
                                     and rewrite plain entry misses inside a
                                     window as <base>_<crc>:<offset>, naming
                                     the image the dump holds (or the saved one
                                     that is the same code with other data)
  windows.py trim <dir> [<entries file>]
                                     bring a folder of images down to the limits
                                     below and tidy the entries file to match

The RAM dump is the one the runner writes with PS2_DUMP, so at a halt it holds
exactly the image the game was running when it called the missing entry.

The folder is bounded, because the build translates every image in it (a window
that shares its memory with changing data gets a new name, the CRC, every time:
Tekken 5 wrote 374 MB in a few runs). The same rules as runtime/src/ee_live.cpp:
an image that differs from a saved one at the same address in at most 1/16 of its
words is the same code with other data and is not saved again; at most 8 images
per address, 32 in all, 16 MiB together, the least recently used go first. Only
names of the form <8 hex>_<8 hex>.bin are managed.
